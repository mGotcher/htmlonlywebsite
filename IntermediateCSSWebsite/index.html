        <h2>Welcome to my website.</h2>
        <p>This portion of my website was made with a bit more then basic CSS and html as part of me learning how to do better web design, and wanting to show the evolution of a project.</p>
        <h2>Same old About me Section</h2>
        <p>Working primarily as a java developer lately I've become the scrum leader for an agile development team. On top of that my development responsiblities have had me work in Java, SQL, HTML, Javascript, AWS Environment creation and more.</p>
        <p>This website was created using only html it will be the first of many steps as I begin to show what adding CSS can do and adding JavaScript to make a website look even better</p>
        <p>Please follow me for this journey as I begin to learn more and more about web development and learn how to take my skills in html, css, and javascript and bring them all together!</p>
