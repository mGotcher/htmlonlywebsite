        <h2>Like the picture shows CSS is awesome.</h2>
        <p>This portion of my website was made with a bit more then basic CSS and html as part of me learning how to do better web design, and wanting to show the evolution of a website from inital HTML to a full functioning website. If you like the concept feel free to share this website or let me know using the contact me link at the bottom.</p>
      
        <!--<h2>Same old About me Section</h2>
        <p>Working primarily as a java developer lately I've become the scrum leader for an agile development team. On top of that my development responsiblities have had me work in Java, SQL, HTML, Javascript, AWS Environment creation and more.</p>
        <p>This website was created using only html it will be the first of many steps as I begin to show what adding CSS can do and adding JavaScript to make a website look even better</p>
        <p>Please follow me for this journey as I begin to learn more and more about web development and learn how to take my skills in html, css, and javascript and bring them all together!</p>
        -->
        <h2>What was added as part of me using "half decent" css</h2>
        <!--<p>Previously we had some basic CSS being used adding some color and making the other website look half decent. Here we decide to switch to a dedicated color scheme (It's somewhere between a dark theme/ Neon Theme), and we used better sizing for the website. Not only are we using better Sizing and Colors, but we also have a cool new Skills section that uses some CSS magic.</p>
        -->
        <ol>
          <li>A new color scheme that's half dark theme/ half neon theme</li>
          <li>Better Sizing that should adjust to screen size</li>
          <li>Center Text Format that should help mobile readability</li>
          <li>A really cool way to showcase skills that I'm proficent in</li>
          <li>Some light margin work/ better formatting</li>
          <li>Seperation of work experience/ education to another page</li>
          <li>Use of button CSS for links that makes everything look much better</li>
          <li>A very poor setup for Experience/Education pages</li>
